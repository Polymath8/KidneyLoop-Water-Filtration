## What It Is
KidneyLoop is a modular water recirculation and filtration system using common parts from online stores. It uses filters and UV-C light to sanitize water over repeated loops, mimicking the human kidney.

It can be scaled from a 5-gallon DIY system to a 1000+ gallon community loop with solar power.

## Core Components
- 2x Rain Barrels or Tanks (50–1000 gallons)
- 2x 12V Micro Water Pumps
- 1x UV-C Sterilizer (12W inline)
- 2x Micron Filters
- Food-Grade Tubing (1/4" ID)
- Optional: Carbon Block Filter (for fluoride/chlorine)
- Optional: Solar Panel & Battery

## How It Works
1. Water is pumped from the "dirty" tank through a micron filter.
2. It passes through a UV-C sterilizer to kill pathogens.
3. Then through another micron filter and into the clean tank.
4. A second pump cycles clean tank water back to the dirty one.
5. Each pass increases clarity and safety.

Add a carbon filter to remove chemicals like chlorine or fluoride.

## Notes
- Works with tap, rain, or stream water.
- All parts are open-source friendly and DIY installable.
- You MUST test water before drinking. This is not FDA/EPA certified.
- The system is not pressurized and uses basic flow design.
- Replace UV-C bulbs after 8000 hours. Clean filters regularly.
