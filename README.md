# KidneyLoop Water Filtration System



**An Open-Source Solution for Clean Water Access Worldwide**

The **KidneyLoop Water Filtration System** is a collection of open-source designs aimed at providing clean, safe drinking water to the 700 million people worldwide who lack access (FAO, 2023). Using UV-C disinfection and fine filtration, KidneyLoop removes 99.9% of bacteria, offering affordable, scalable, and portable solutions for individuals, households, and communities in water-scarce regions. Released under a **Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)** license, these designs are free for anyone to build, modify, and share.

## Project Overview

The KidneyLoop project began with a simple goal: to create a low-cost, solar-powered water purifier that anyone can build. Over time, it evolved into a multi-variant system serving different contexts—from rural homes to disaster zones. Each unit leverages:

- **UV-C Disinfection:** 210 mJ/cm² per pass (99% bacterial reduction, 99.9% in 3 passes)
- **Filtration:** 0.1 μm fine filter for microbial removal

## KidneyLoop Variants

Each variant has its own white paper detailing specifications, build instructions, and use cases.

### 1. Flat Tray Design (Original)
- **Type:** Household unit with a shallow UV-C tray
- **Capacity:** 5 gallons per cycle
- **Cycle Time:** 9.45 minutes (3 passes)
- **Cost:** $28–$102
- **Use Case:** Rural families (4–6 people)


### 2. Tube Design
- **Type:** UV-C tube with LED wrap for higher throughput
- **Capacity:** 5 gallons per cycle
- **Cycle Time:** 9.45 minutes
- **Cost:** $241.50–$399
- **Use Case:** Small communities (20–30 people)

## Vision for Global Impact

KidneyLoop aims to transform water access through **open-source innovation**. By deploying these systems in crisis zones, rural schools, and villages, we aim to:

- Eliminate waterborne diseases
- Empower local builders and communities
- Inspire collaboration with NGOs like UNICEF and WaterAid
- Save lives and improve global health outcomes
