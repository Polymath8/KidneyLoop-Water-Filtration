# KidneyLoop: A Modular DIY Water Sanitation System  
*Open Source | CC0 License | Community-Modifiable*

## Overview
KidneyLoop is a DIY water recirculation and sanitation system designed for anyone who wants affordable, modular, and effective water purification. It’s inspired by the natural kidney process—filter, cleanse, and recirculate—and is built using everyday components like UV-C sterilizers, food-safe tubing, and rain barrels. Whether you’re off-grid, prepping, or just experimenting, this project is yours to build and evolve.

## Project Goals
- **Affordable** – Built with parts you can find on Amazon or in hardware stores.
- **Modular** – Easily upgrade filters, swap sterilizers, or scale up.
- **Simple** – No coding, welding, or chemistry needed.
- **Effective** – Dual filtration plus UV-C to kill pathogens.
- **Open-Source** – CC0 license: use, sell, remix, and improve.

## How It Works
Water loops from a "dirty" tank through:
1. A **micron filter** to remove sediment.
2. A **UV-C light chamber** to kill bacteria and viruses.
3. A second **micron filter** to polish the water.
4. Into a **clean tank**.

Then a return pump recirculates water back to the dirty tank for more passes. Run 3 to 6 cycles depending on clarity and source.

## What You'll Need (Example Parts)
- **Two Rain Barrels or Tanks** (e.g. 50gal PVC Rain Barrel
- **12V Micro Pumps** (HiLetgo 240L/hr ×2)
- **Micron Filters** (5µm or 0.1µm mesh)
- **12W Coospider UV-C Sterilizer** (inline, rated for 500gal)
- **Food-Grade Tubing** (1/4" ID)
- **20W 12V Solar Panel** + charge controller
- **Fittings, Grommets, Sealant** for watertight ports

## Assembly Summary
1. Drill 2 holes in each barrel (top edge).
2. Install barbed or threaded fittings with gaskets/sealant.
3. Dirty Tank → Pump → Micron Filter → UV-C Sterilizer → Micron Filter → Clean Tank.
4. Clean Tank → Return Pump → Dirty Tank.
5. Power via solar panel or adapter.
6. Start loop and monitor clarity.

## Estimated Cost
- Full setup: ~$150–$200 USD (with solar)
- Grid-power only: ~$100–$140

## FAQs
**Can it remove fluoride or chlorine?**  
No, not without a carbon block filter.

**Is it safe for drinking?**  
This is a DIY project, not certified for potable use. Test your water first.

**What kind of water can I clean?**  
Best for rainwater, well water, or stream water. Not for sewage or seawater.

**How long does it take?**  
About 30–60 minutes for 3 full recirculations on 10 gallons.

**Can I scale it?**  
Yes. Just upsize tanks, pumps, UV-C unit, and filters.
